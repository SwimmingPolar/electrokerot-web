                  Due to this buggy behavior, DummyDiv and outer motion.div are required,

                  Countermeasure: the key point is to not allow the user to close the modals when they are animating
                  1 Disable the default feature of mui modal that closes the modal
                  when user press 'esc'. (ModalLayout)
                  2. Add custom 'esc' feature that closes the modal only when the modal is not animating. (ModalLayout)
                  3. Disable navigation between modals when the modal is animating.  */}
